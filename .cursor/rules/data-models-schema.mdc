## Core Data Models [Importance: 95]

### Template Schema
- Stores metadata for uploaded spreadsheet templates
- Fields:
  - id: unique identifier
  - name: template name
  - file_path: storage location of template file
  - metadata: custom template fields
- Path: `src/models/template.rs`

### Sample Schema 
- Tracks submitted samples through the system
- Fields:
  - id: unique identifier
  - barcode: unique tracking barcode
  - status: current sample state (Pending/Validated/InStorage/InSequencing/Completed)
  - location: storage location identifier
  - template_id: associated template reference
- Path: `src/models/mod.rs`

### Sequencing Job Schema
- Manages sequencing job metadata
- Fields:
  - id: unique identifier
  - name: job name
  - status: job state (Pending/InProgress/Completed/Failed)
  - sample_id: reference to associated sample
  - sample_sheet_path: path to generated sample sheet
- Path: `src/models/mod.rs`

### Storage Location Schema
- Tracks physical storage locations and barcodes
- Fields:
  - id: unique identifier
  - barcode: location barcode
  - type: storage type (Freezer/Shelf/Box)
  - parent_id: hierarchical reference to parent location
- Path: `src/storage/mod.rs`

## Relationships [Importance: 90]

### Sample-Template Relationship
- Many-to-one relationship between samples and templates
- Enforced by foreign key constraint on template_id
- Required for sample validation and processing

### Sample-Job Relationship
- One-to-many relationship between samples and sequencing jobs
- Enforced by foreign key constraint on sample_id
- Tracks which samples are being sequenced

### Location Hierarchy
- Self-referential relationship in storage locations
- Enables nested storage tracking (Freezer > Shelf > Box)
- Enforced by foreign key constraint on parent_id
