## Core Data Flow Paths

### Template Processing Flow (Importance: 85)
1. Frontend upload (`frontend/src/pages/Templates.tsx`) -> Backend handler (`src/handlers/mod.rs`)
2. Handler validates and stores template file
3. Template metadata extracted and stored in database
4. Template ID returned to frontend for reference

### Sample Submission Flow (Importance: 90)
1. Frontend wizard (`frontend/src/pages/Samples.tsx`) initiates submission
2. Sample data + template reference sent to submission handler (`src/sample_submission/mod.rs`)
3. Sample metadata validated against template structure
4. Storage module (`src/storage/mod.rs`) generates and assigns barcode
5. Sample status updated to "Validated"

### Sequencing Job Creation Flow (Importance: 95)
1. Frontend interface (`frontend/src/pages/Sequencing.tsx`) triggers job creation
2. Job request sent to sequencing handler (`src/sequencing/mod.rs`)
3. Handler verifies sample validation status
4. Sample sheet created from template data
5. Job metadata stored and linked to sample
6. Storage status updated via storage module

### Storage Management Flow (Importance: 85)
1. Sample submission triggers barcode generation
2. Storage location assigned through storage module
3. Location data linked to sample record
4. Status updates propagated to sample tracking

## Integration Points

### Template-Sample Integration (Importance: 80)
- Template ID required for sample creation
- Template structure validates sample data
- Template fields map to sample attributes

### Sample-Sequencing Integration (Importance: 85)
- Valid sample required for job creation
- Sample metadata used for sequencing parameters
- Job status updates reflect back to sample status

### Storage-Sample Integration (Importance: 75)
- Barcode generation tied to sample creation
- Location tracking updates sample record
- Status changes trigger storage updates
