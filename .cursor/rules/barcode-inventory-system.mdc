# barcode-inventory-system

## Core Components

### Barcode Management
**Importance Score: 95**
- Sample tracking through unique barcode associations
- Barcodes serve as primary identifiers for physical storage locations
- Direct integration with sample submission workflow
- Path: `src/sample_submission/mod.rs`

### Storage Location Tracking
**Importance Score: 90**
- Maintains mapping between barcodes and physical storage positions
- Tracks sample movement through different storage areas
- Path: `src/storage/mod.rs`

### Inventory State Machine
**Importance Score: 85**
- Sample status transitions:
  - Pending → Validated → InStorage → InSequencing → Completed
- Storage location validation during state changes
- Path: `src/models/mod.rs`

### Sample-Storage Association Rules
**Importance Score: 80**
- Each sample requires valid barcode assignment before storage
- Storage locations must be validated before sample assignment
- Tracks sample history through storage transitions
- Path: `src/storage/mod.rs`

### Frontend Integration
**Importance Score: 75**
- Barcode scanning interface for sample lookup
- Storage location visualization
- Sample status display and updates
- Path: `frontend/src/pages/Samples.tsx`

## Business Rules

### Storage Assignment
**Importance Score: 85**
- Samples cannot be assigned to occupied storage locations
- Storage locations must be validated before sample assignment
- Path: `src/storage/mod.rs`

### Barcode Generation
**Importance Score: 90**
- Unique barcode generation for each sample
- Validation of barcode uniqueness in database
- Path: `src/sample_submission/mod.rs`

### Sample Movement Tracking
**Importance Score: 85**
- Records all sample movements between storage locations
- Maintains audit trail of sample handling
- Path: `src/storage/mod.rs`
